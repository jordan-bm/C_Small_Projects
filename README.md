## Overview

### Install C/C++ Extension for more effeciency
- After installation, open the file you want to run, run it, and choose "C/C++: gcc build and debug active file" when prompted

This repository contains assignments focused on different programming skills:

- **area_calculator.c** - Interactive program to calculate the area of rectangle, triangle, and circle with input validation
- **array_operations.c** - Command-line tool for array operations: printing elements, summing values, finding max, and detecting primes. See `ArrayOp_InputExamples.txt` for input examples (if needed)
- **password_validator.c** - Validates passwords based on length, character types, and spacing, with detailed feedback
- **student_grade_processor/grade_processor.c** - Reads student grades from `students.csv`, computes weighted results, outputs grade report to`grade_info.txt`

## Features

- Interactive CLI applications and batch processors
- Dynamic memory management and file input/output
- Parsing CSV data and generating reports
- Basic algorithms such as prime detection, summing, max finding
- Strong input validation and error handling
- Use of `structs` and modular functions for clarity and reuse
